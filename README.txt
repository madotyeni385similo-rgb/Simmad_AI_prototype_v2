Simmad AI Assistant - Static Prototype (Mock)

Files:
- index.html : The main prototype page (open in a browser)
- styles.css : Styling
- data.js    : Sample product data used by the prototype
- script.js  : Client-side logic (mock AI behaviour)

How to use:
1. Download and unzip the package.
2. Open index.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
3. Use the controls to set budget, keywords, or paste a mock product link for analysis.
4. Chatbox accepts queries like "Find me a running shoe under 800".

Notes:
- This is a front-end prototype with mock/sample data. To turn it into a real AI assistant, you'll need a back-end (server),
  product APIs or web-scraping for live prices, and a real NLP/LLM service for analysis.
- I can help integrate a backend and real APIs next if you'd like.
